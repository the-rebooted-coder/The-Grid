Congratulations. You have stumbled upon the digital equivalent of a fossil.

We realized that waiting 24 hours for a GitHub Action to update a static image was... primitive. So we killed this script and built a **real application**.

If you want the old, slow, static version where you have to fork a repo just to change a date, keep reading. If you value your time (which is ironic, given the purpose of this tool), go to the new one.

## 🚀 The Upgrade

We rebuilt **The Grid** from scratch.

* **It's Real-Time:** No more waiting for midnight.
* **It's Dynamic:** Change views (Month, Quarter, Year) instantly.
* **It's Customizable:** Dark mode, custom signatures, progress bar styles.
* **It mocks you:** If you try to generate a default grid without customizing it, the code judges you.
